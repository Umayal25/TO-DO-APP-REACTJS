Hello guys!!
To-Do App using React.js

Introduction

Welcome to the To-Do App using React.js! This application helps you manage your tasks efficiently. Whether you're a busy professional, a student, or simply someone who wants to stay organized, this app is designed to make your life easier.
 Why To-Do Lists Are Essential

To-Do lists are an essential tool for time management and productivity. They help you:

Stay Organized: Keep track of all your tasks in one place.
Prioritize Tasks:Identify and focus on the most important tasks.
Reduce Stress: By clearing your mind and knowing what needs to be done.
Improve Productivity:Increase your efficiency by tackling tasks systematically.
Achieve Goals:Move closer to achieving your long-term objectives.
Features
Progressive Web App

Our To-Do App is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can access it on any device with a web browser. Install it on your mobile device or desktop, and it will work offline, just like a native app.

 Local and Session Storage

Your tasks are securely stored in your browser's local and session storage. This means your to-do list will persist even if you close your browser or navigate away from the page temporarily. No need to worry about losing your tasks.
Material-UI Integration
Iâ€™ve integrated Material-UI into  To-Do App, providing a sleek and modern user interface. Material-UI not only enhances the app's visual appeal but also improves the overall user experience. With Material-UI, you'll enjoy a clean and intuitive design.


Categorization Based on Status
Organize your tasks with ease by categorizing them based on their status. You can mark tasks as:

To-Do:Tasks you need to complete.
In Progress: Tasks you're currently working on.
Done:Tasks you've completed.
This categorization helps you visualize your progress and focus on what's important.
Responsiveness
The app is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. Whether you're using it on a smartphone, tablet, or desktop, you'll have a seamless user experience.
